            <p> The MotiBot application described is solely intended for research purposes. It has been developed by a team of Computer Science students from Laguna State Polytechnic University (LSPU) San Pablo as part of their capstone project. MotiBot aims to test the suitability of the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) algorithm for potential applications in mental health support. While the students have applied rigorous research and cutting-edge technologies in its development, MotiBot has not undergone validation for practical use. Users should be aware that its effectiveness as a mental health support tool has not been confirmed, and it should not be relied upon as such.

                Additionally, due to the sensitive nature of mental health topics, MotiBot's dataset is limited. This limitation means that the chatbot may not recognize or respond appropriately to all user queries. Users should understand that MotiBot's responses might be limited in scope and may not capture the full complexity of mental health issues. Therefore, it is essential to approach MotiBot with caution and not consider it a comprehensive mental health support tool.</p>
